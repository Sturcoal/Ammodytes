# Ammodytidae
Public information and datasets on the investigation of species diversity and population genetics among sand lances (Uranoscopiformes: Ammodytidae)

----

Table [S1](https://github.com/Sturcoal/Ammodytes/blob/master/Table%20S1.csv) - the information on taxonomy and location of the speciemens linked to the *COI* sequences that were used to build the reference library for sand lances identification.

Table [S2](https://github.com/Sturcoal/Ammodytes/blob/master/Table%20S2.csv) - intra- and interspecific genetic *COI* gene distances among sand lances, calculated based on TrN+G substitution model.
