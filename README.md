# Ammodytidae
Pucblic information and datasets on the investigation of species diversity and population genetics among sand lances (Uranoscopiformes: Ammodytidae)

Table S1 - the information on taxonomy and location of the speciemens linked to the *COI* sequences that were used to build the reference library for sand lances identification.

Table S2 - intra- and interspecific genetic *COI* gene distances among sand lances, calculated based on TrN+G substitution model.
